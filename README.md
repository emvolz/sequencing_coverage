# Sequencing coverage and weights

We compute and present the coverage of sequence sampling in local authorities (LAs) in the UK. 
We define the coverage as the number of sequences per case. We calculate one value per day per LA. 
In order to smooth the effects of small numbers, the number of sequences and cases given to a day is 
the sum of sequences or cases over the preceding two weeks.

Sequences are counted from the COG-UK server, and cases are accessed from the ONS API ().
